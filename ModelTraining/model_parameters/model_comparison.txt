Machine Learning Model Comparison
This document provides a comparison of various machine learning models based on their accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and additional characteristics. 
The evaluation metrics help in selecting the best model for classification tasks.

Metrics Explained
Train Accuracy & Test Accuracy: Measures the model's correctness on training and test data.

Train Precision & Test Precision: The proportion of correctly identified positive cases.

Train Recall & Test Recall: The ability of the model to find all relevant cases.

Train F1 Score & Test F1 Score: A balance between precision and recall.
